# Reporting a security issue

If you think the bug you found is likely to make Netty-based applications
vulnerable to an attack, please do not use our public issue tracker but
report it privately at the 'Security' tab of the affected repository,
as explained [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

This project is maintained by a team of volunteers on a reasonable-effort basis. As
such, please give us 90 days to remediate the vulnerability before public disclosure.

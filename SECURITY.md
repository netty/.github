# Our security policy

## Reporting a security issue

If you think the bug you found is likely to make Netty-based applications
vulnerable to an attack, please do not use our public issue tracker but
report it privately at the 'Security' tab of the affected repository,
as explained [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

This project is maintained by a team of volunteers on a reasonable-effort basis. As
such, please give us 90 days to remediate the vulnerability before public disclosure.

## Security updates

We maintain the most recent minor version of our artifacts for each supported major
version. Please note this includes neither pre-releases nor the major versions that
reached their end-of-life.

As of May 2023, the following Netty versions have reached their end-of-life, and thus
no security updates will be provided:

- 3.x
- 4.0

Please keep in mind that the above list may be out-of-date and contact the Netty team
to ensure the version you're using is covered.
